<h6>What does it mean?</h6>

You know, one rat encodes, the other decodes. Rat neural interfaces strike a
note in us all.

<h6>Who are you?</h6>
We are two rats shitposting. Encoder Rat Decoder Rat (EüêÄDüêÄ) is creative
technologists Dylan Box (they/them) and M Kuznetsov (they/them), who first met
through queer leftbook. Their vision is to explore the rat techno future (a lens
for radical digital explorations). Gender Generator is their official debut
project, preceded by hours of honing their craft of gender shitposting. Their
work is influenced by Os Keyes, data feminism, and their personal experiences
being perceived. Individually, M‚Äôs previous work has focused on designing and
questioning alternative futures, such as their newsletter, The Finkedin
Dispatch, and a zine on exploring drag influences for adversarial attacks on
facial recognition. Dylan‚Äôs work has focused on building and supporting
community-driven creative spaces in Detroit. They have worked developing
branding and curriculum for the Mt. Elliott Makerspace and the Hype Teen Center,
and the opening of two art galleries and studios, The Untitled Bottega and
Riopelle Collective.

<h6>What kind of work do you make, have made, and want to make?</h6>
Our debut project Gender Generator premiered at the MIT CAST Unfolding AI
Symposium. Projects we‚Äôd like to work on:

<ul>
  <li>This gender does not exist</li>
  <li>Trans people naming list</li>
  <li>UI as art</li>
  <li>Are you a wave or a particle?</li>
  <li>Attack Helicopter: the malware that drops gender columns from</li>
  databases
  <li>AR app that overlays trans flags over American flags</li>
</ul>

<h6>What inspires you?</h6>
Ultimately, we see this project as one interface in the face of a new design
future, with the goal of queering the entire internet. Want to work with us?
