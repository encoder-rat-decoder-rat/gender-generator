<h6>About the piece</h6>
<p>
  The ways programmers organize, collect, and sort gender data and subsequent
  user interfaces reflect their society’s assumptions: male or female, singular,
  static. In datasets, gender is frequently assigned post-collection, assumed by
  visual cues rooted in socialization. When input by a user, any interface fails
  to capture the true magnitude of a gender.
</p>
<p>
  We now have the computational power to traverse every gender. We must ask: we
  do want to be categorized this way? After all, queerness rebukes labels; data
  science inherently classifies through arbitrary boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  Gender Generator is a novel interface for gender selection, drawing from the
  potential of computational gender. By trawling categories and visualizing
  their overlaps, the algorithm presents an increasing amount of binary choices,
  inviting the viewer to interpret the resulting data. The morphing shapes
  encourage us to seek joy in uncertainty; divine our nebulous identities in the
  past, present, and future; rebuke schemas.
