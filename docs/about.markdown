Encoder Rat Decoder Rat (E🐀D🐀) is creative technologists Dylan Box (they/them) and M Kuznetsov (they/them), who first met through queer leftbook. Their vision is to explore the rat techno future (a lens for radical digital explorations). Gender Generator is their official debut project, preceded by hours of honing their craft of gender shitposting. Their work is influenced by Os Keyes, data feminism, and their personal experiences being perceived.

Individually, M’s previous work has focused on designing and questioning alternative futures, such as their newsletter, The Finkedin Dispatch, and a zine on exploring drag influences for adversarial attacks on facial recognition.

Dylan’s work has focused on building and supporting community-driven creative spaces in Detroit. They have worked developing branding and curriculum for the Mt. Elliott Makerspace and the Hype Teen Center, and the opening of two art galleries and studios, The Untitled Bottega and Riopelle Collective.
