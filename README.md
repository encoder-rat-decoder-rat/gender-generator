# Gender Generator
_A novel user interface for gender input by Encoder Rat Decoder Rat_

Every UI is an abstraction that simply cannot capture the true magnitude of a gender identity. By trawling categories and visualizing their overlaps, the algorithm presents an increasing amount of binary choices, inviting the viewer to interpret the resulting data. The morphing shapes encourage us to seek joy in uncertainty; divine our nebulous identities in the past, present, and future; rebuke schemas.
