# Gender Generator
_A novel user interface for gender input by Encoder Rat Decoder Rat_

Every UI is an abstraction that simply cannot capture the true magnitude of a gender identity. By trawling categories and visualizing their overlaps, the algorithm presents an increasing amount of binary choices, inviting the viewer to interpret the resulting data. We see ourselves reflected on the screen in a way that feels familiar but foreign. Pixel icons drawn from the contemporary queer culture and computer operating systems offer up combinations of traits: what is masc, what is femme, what is a computer? Which dizzyingly complex combination of fields and properties and descriptors would be most accurate to our gender(s)? The morphing shapes encourage us to seek joy in uncertainty; divine our nebulous identities in the past, present, and future; rebuke schemas.
